= AssetCloud

An abstraction layer around arbitrary and diverse asset stores.

== Value Hash vs Checksum

+value_hash+ is intended as a *private* hash/checksum, not exposed to end users. Its underlying algorithm is private, and
could change over time so should not be relied on by clients.

+checksum+ is intended as a *public* hash/checksum, exposed to end users. Its underlying algorithm is documented (e.g. MD5)
and is not expected to change.

== Releasing

Releasing is handled by Shopify's internal Shipit server.

After merging a change, a separate PR should be opened to update +History.md+ and bump the version
(following {Semantic Versioning}[https://semver.org]).

When merged, the new release will be automatically tagged and deployed to rubygems.org.

Note that the automatic process does not create a new {release}[https://github.com/Shopify/asset_cloud/releases] on GitHub.
