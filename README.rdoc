= AssetCloud

An abstraction layer around arbitrary and diverse asset stores.

== Value Hash vs Checksum

+value_hash+ is intended as a *private* hash/checksum, not exposed to end users. Its underlying algorithm is private,
and could change over time so should not be relied on by clients.

+checksum+ is intended as a *public* hash/checksum, exposed to end users. Its underlying algorithm is documented (e.g.
MD5) and is not expected to change.
